# Uge 06
## Opgave 1
Both are linear, so both the average case and the worst case is $$\Theta(n)$$

## Opgave 2

$$A = \langle {\bf31,41},59,26,41,58 \rangle$$

$$A = \langle {\bf31,41,59},26,41,58 \rangle $$

$$A = \langle {\bf26,31,41,59},41,58 \rangle $$

$$A = \langle {\bf26,31,41,41,59},58 \rangle $$

$$A = \langle {\bf26,31,41,41,58,59} \rangle $$
